# Challenge 1

I first modified the given program to find how is it working and how to modify it to convert a given string to encoded and then from encoded to given string. I used simple froxhex and format functions to get the flag after discovering that if i xor the 2 bytes with 4 bytes starting from 0 to length of flag , I will recieve the 4 correct bytes.

# Challenge 2

This challenge was a bit easy , only the number systems in which the ascii values of the characters were encoded needed to be identified.
