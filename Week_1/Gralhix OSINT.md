 Photo : https://gralhix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/osint-exercise-004-big-picture.jpg
 , on reverse image search using google , I first chose Tailana Island Resort as it was only one resort one island and the coral structure underneath the island looked same.

Also , I was able to find the same picture on https://oanresort.wixsite.com/chuuk
The location coordinates of Oan Resort are:

- Latitude: 7.3620838°

- Longitude: 151.756382°
  
  According to brave search, which are verified by putting the values in google maps.
