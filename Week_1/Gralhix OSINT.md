Now , both of these locations are located in Tashkent , uzbekistan . So , I checked out the trains that ran in Tashkent, Uzbekistan during morning time, as the photo with the car is of morning time.

![](Gralhix%20OSINT/2024-06-11-18-15-11-image.png)

The video of the journey shows the trains is fast and also I  checked out some youtube  videos of people sitting in the train and filming outside and the only train that showed similiar speed and sound was Afrosiyob train. Also, the timing of the train is in morning only. So according to the data, the boarding station is Tashkent , but I am not sure about the alight , it may or may not be samarkand as I was unable to figure out the location of last photo.
